/**
 * `linode.ProducerImageShareGroupMember` provides details about a Member of an Image Share Group.
 * For more information, see the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-sharegroup-member-token). May not be currently available to all users even under v4beta.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example shows how the datasource might be used to obtain additional information about a member of an Image Share Group.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const member = linode.getProducerImageShareGroupMember({
 *     sharegroupId: 12345,
 *     tokenUuid: "db58ab2e-3021-4b08-9426-8e456f6dd268",
 * });
 * ```
