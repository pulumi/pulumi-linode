/**
 * Provides information about a Linode domain.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * The following example shows how one might use this data source to access information about a Linode domain.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 * 
 * const bar = pulumi.output(linode.getDomain({
 *     domain: "bar.example.com",
 * }));
 * const foo = pulumi.output(linode.getDomain({
 *     id: "1234567",
 * }));
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Attributes
 * 
 * The Linode Domain resource exports the following attributes:
 * 
 * * `id` - The unique ID of this Domain.
 * 
 * * `domain` - The domain this Domain represents. These must be unique in our system; you cannot have two Domains representing the same domain
 * 
 * * `type` - If this Domain represents the authoritative source of information for the domain it describes, or if it is a read-only copy of a master (also called a slave)
 * 
 * * `group` - The group this Domain belongs to.
 * 
 * * `status` - Used to control whether this Domain is currently being rendered.
 * 
 * * `description` - A description for this Domain.
 * 
 * * `master_ips` - The IP addresses representing the master DNS for this Domain.
 * 
 * * `axfr_ips` - The list of IPs that may perform a zone transfer for this Domain.
 * 
 * * `ttl_sec` - 'Time to Live'-the amount of time in seconds that this Domain's records may be cached by resolvers or other domain servers.
 * 
 * * `retry_sec` - The interval, in seconds, at which a failed refresh should be retried.
 * *
 * * `expire_sec` - The amount of time in seconds that may pass before this Domain is no longer authoritative.
 * 
 * * `refresh_sec` - The amount of time in seconds before this Domain should be refreshed.
 * 
 * * `soa_email` - Start of Authority email address.
 * 
 * * `tags` - An array of tags applied to this object.
