/**
 * Provides information about a Linode image
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 * 
 * const k8Master = pulumi.output(linode.getImage({
 *     id: "linode/debian8",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Attributes
 * 
 * The Linode Image resource exports the following attributes:
 * 
 * * `label` - A short description of the Image.
 * 
 * * `created` - When this Image was created.
 * 
 * * `createdBy` - The name of the User who created this Image, or "linode" for official Images.
 * 
 * * `deprecated` - Whether or not this Image is deprecated. Will only be true for deprecated public Images.
 * 
 * * `description` - A detailed description of this Image.
 * 
 * * `isPublic` - True if the Image is public.
 * 
 * * `size` - The minimum size this Image needs to deploy. Size is in MB. example: 2500
 * 
 * * `type` - How the Image was created. Manual Images can be created at any time. image"Automatic" Images are created automatically from a deleted Linode.
 * 
 * * `vendor` - The upstream distribution vendor. `None` for private Images.
