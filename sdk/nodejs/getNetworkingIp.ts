/**
 * Provides information about a Linode Networking IP Address
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * The following example shows how one might use this data source to access information about a Linode Networking IP Address.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 * 
 * const ns1LinodeCom = pulumi.output(linode.getImage({
 *     address: "162.159.27.72",
 * }));
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Attributes
 * 
 * The Linode Network IP Address resource exports the following attributes:
 * 
 * * `address` - The IP address.
 * 
 * * `gateway` - The default gateway for this address.
 * 
 * * `subnet_mask` - The mask that separates host bits from network bits for this address.
 * 
 * * `prefix` - The number of bits set in the subnet mask.
 * 
 * * `type` - The type of address this is (ipv4, ipv6, ipv6/pool, ipv6/range).
 * 
 * * `public` - Whether this is a public or private IP address.
 * 
 * * `rdns` - The reverse DNS assigned to this address. For public IPv4 addresses, this will be set to a default value provided by Linode if not explicitly set.
 * 
 * * `linode_id` - The ID of the Linode this address currently belongs to.
 * 
 * * `region` - The Region this IP address resides in.
