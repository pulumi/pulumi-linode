/**
 * Provides a Linode Token resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linode API Personal Access Tokens.  Personal Access Tokens proxy user credentials for Linode API access.  This is necessary for tools, to interact with Linode services on a user's behalf.
 *
 * It is common for the provider itself to be configured with broadly scoped Personal Access Tokens.  Provisioning scripts or tools configured within a Linode Instance should follow the principle of least privilege to afford only the required roles for tools to perform their necessary tasks.  The `linode.Token` resource allows for the management of Personal Access Tokens with scopes mirroring or narrowing the scope of the parent token.
 *
 * For more information, see the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4#operation/getTokens).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a token for use in another tool that needs access to Linode resources.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const fooToken = new linode.Token("foo", {
 *     expiry: "2100-01-02T03:04:05Z",
 *     label: "token",
 *     scopes: "linodes:read_only",
 * });
 * const fooInstance = new linode.Instance("foo", {});
 * ```
 * ## Attributes
 *
 * This resource exports the following attributes:
 *
 * * `token` - The token used to access the API.
 *
 * * `created` - The date this Token was created.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Linodes Tokens can be imported using the Linode Token `id`, e.g.
 *
 * The secret token will not be imported.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import linode:index/token:Token mytoken 1234567
 * ```
