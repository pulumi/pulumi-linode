/**
 * Provides details about a specific Linode StackScript.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * The following example shows how one might use this data source to access information about a Linode StackScript.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Attributes
 * 
 * This resource exports the following attributes:
 * 
 * * `label` - The StackScript's label is for display purposes only.
 * 
 * * `script` - The script to execute when provisioning a new Linode with this StackScript.
 * 
 * * `description` - A description for the StackScript.
 * 
 * * `revNote` - This field allows you to add notes for the set of revisions made to this StackScript.
 * 
 * * `isPublic` - This determines whether other users can use your StackScript. Once a StackScript is made public, it cannot be made private.
 * 
 * * `images` - An array of Image IDs representing the Images that this StackScript is compatible for deploying with.
 * 
 * * `deploymentsActive` - Count of currently active, deployed Linodes created from this StackScript.
 * 
 * * `userGravatarId` - The Gravatar ID for the User who created the StackScript.
 * 
 * * `deploymentsTotal` - The total number of times this StackScript has been deployed.
 * 
 * * `username` - The User who created the StackScript.
 * 
 * * `created` - The date this StackScript was created.
 * 
 * * `updated` - The date this StackScript was updated.
 * 
 * * `userDefinedFields` - This is a list of fields defined with a special syntax inside this StackScript that allow for supplying customized parameters during deployment.
 * 
 *   * `label` - A human-readable label for the field that will serve as the input prompt for entering the value during deployment.
 * 
 *   * `name` - The name of the field.
 * 
 *   * `example` - An example value for the field.
 * 
 *   * `oneOf` - A list of acceptable single values for the field.
 * 
 *   * `manyOf` - A list of acceptable values for the field in any quantity, combination or order.
 * 
 *   * `default` - The default value. If not specified, this value will be used.
