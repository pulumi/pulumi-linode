/**
 * Provides a Linode Instance resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linodes.
 * For more information, see [Getting Started with Linode](https://linode.com/docs/getting-started/) and the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4#operation/createLinodeInstance).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Simple Linode Instance
 *
 * The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a Linode instance.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const web = new linode.Instance("web", {
 *     authorizedKeys: ["ssh-rsa AAAA...Gw== user@example.local"],
 *     group: "foo",
 *     image: "linode/ubuntu18.04",
 *     label: "simple_instance",
 *     privateIp: true,
 *     region: "us-central",
 *     rootPass: "terr4form-test",
 *     swapSize: 256,
 *     tags: ["foo"],
 *     type: "g6-standard-1",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Linode Instance with explicit Configs and Disks
 *
 * Using explicit Instance Configs and Disks it is possible to create a more elaborate Linode instance.  This can be used to provision multiple disks and volumes during Instance creation.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const me = linode.getProfile({});
 * const webVolume = new linode.Volume("webVolume", {
 *     label: "web_volume",
 *     size: 20,
 *     region: "us-central",
 * });
 * const web = new linode.Instance("web", {
 *     label: "complex_instance",
 *     group: "foo",
 *     tags: ["foo"],
 *     region: "us-central",
 *     type: "g6-nanode-1",
 *     privateIp: true,
 *     disks: [{
 *         label: "boot",
 *         size: 3000,
 *         image: "linode/ubuntu18.04",
 *         authorizedKeys: ["ssh-rsa AAAA...Gw== user@example.local"],
 *         authorizedUsers: [me.then(me => me.username)],
 *         rootPass: "terr4form-test",
 *     }],
 *     configs: [{
 *         label: "boot_config",
 *         kernel: "linode/latest-64bit",
 *         devices: {
 *             sda: {
 *                 diskLabel: "boot",
 *             },
 *             sdb: {
 *                 volumeId: webVolume.id,
 *             },
 *         },
 *         rootDevice: "/dev/sda",
 *     }],
 *     bootConfigLabel: "boot_config",
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Attributes
 *
 * This Linode Instance resource exports the following attributes:
 *
 * * `status` - The status of the instance, indicating the current readiness state. (`running`, `offline`, ...)
 *
 * * `ipAddress` - A string containing the Linode's public IP address.
 *
 * * `privateIpAddress` - This Linode's Private IPv4 Address, if enabled.  The regional private IP address range, 192.168.128.0/17, is shared by all Linode Instances in a region.
 *
 * * `ipv6` - This Linode's IPv6 SLAAC addresses. This address is specific to a Linode, and may not be shared.  The prefix (`/64`) is included in this attribute.
 *
 * * `ipv4` - This Linode's IPv4 Addresses. Each Linode is assigned a single public IPv4 address upon creation, and may get a single private IPv4 address if needed. You may need to open a support ticket to get additional IPv4 addresses.
 *
 * * `specs.0.disk` -  The amount of storage space, in GB. this Linode has access to. A typical Linode will divide this space between a primary disk with an image deployed to it, and a swap disk, usually 512 MB. This is the default configuration created when deploying a Linode with an image through POST /linode/instances.
 *
 * * `specs.0.memory` - The amount of RAM, in MB, this Linode has access to. Typically a Linode will choose to boot with all of its available RAM, but this can be configured in a Config profile.
 *
 * * `specs.0.vcpus` - The number of vcpus this Linode has access to. Typically a Linode will choose to boot with all of its available vcpus, but this can be configured in a Config Profile.
 *
 * * `specs.0.transfer` - The amount of network transfer this Linode is allotted each month.
 *
 * * `backups` - Information about this Linode's backups status.
 *   
 *   * `enabled` - If this Linode has the Backup service enabled.
 *   
 *   * `schedule`
 *     
 *     * `day` -  The day of the week that your Linode's weekly Backup is taken. If not set manually, a day will be chosen for you. Backups are taken every day, but backups taken on this day are preferred when selecting backups to retain for a longer period.  If not set manually, then when backups are initially enabled, this may come back as "Scheduling" until the day is automatically selected.
 *     
 *     * `window` - The window ('W0'-'W22') in which your backups will be taken, in UTC. A backups window is a two-hour span of time in which the backup may occur. For example, 'W10' indicates that your backups should be taken between 10:00 and 12:00. If you do not choose a backup window, one will be selected for you automatically.  If not set manually, when backups are initially enabled this may come back as Scheduling until the window is automatically selected.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Linodes Instances can be imported using the Linode `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import linode:index/instance:Instance mylinode 1234567
 * ```
 *
 *  When importing an instance, all `disk` and `config` values must be represented. Imported disks must include their `label` value.
 *
 * **Any disk that is not precisely represented may be removed resulting in data loss.** Imported configs should include all `devices`, and must include `label`, `kernel`, and the `root_device`.
 *
 * The instance must include a `boot_config_label` referring to the correct configuration profile. The Linode Guide, [Import Existing Infrastructure to Terraform](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/configuration-management/import-existing-infrastructure-to-terraform/), offers resource importing examples for Instances and other Linode resource types.
