/**
 * Provides a Linode Instance resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linodes.
 * For more information, see [Getting Started with Linode](https://linode.com/docs/getting-started/) and the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4#operation/createLinodeInstance).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Linodes Instances can be imported using the Linode `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import linode:index/instance:Instance mylinode 1234567
 * ```
 *
 *  When importing an instance, all `disk` and `config` values must be represented. Imported disks must include their `label` value.
 *
 * **Any disk that is not precisely represented may be removed resulting in data loss.** Imported configs should include all `devices`, and must include `label`, `kernel`, and the `root_device`.
 *
 * The instance must include a `boot_config_label` referring to the correct configuration profile.
