/**
 * Provides a Linode Instance resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linodes.
 * For more information, see [Getting Started with Linode](https://linode.com/docs/getting-started/) and the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-linode-instance).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Simple Linode Instance
 *
 * The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a Linode instance.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const web = new linode.Instance("web", {
 *     label: "simple_instance",
 *     image: "linode/ubuntu22.04",
 *     region: "us-central",
 *     type: "g6-standard-1",
 *     authorizedKeys: ["ssh-rsa AAAA...Gw== user@example.local"],
 *     rootPass: "this-is-not-a-safe-password",
 *     tags: ["foo"],
 *     swapSize: 256,
 *     privateIp: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Linode Instance with Explicit Networking Interfaces
 *
 * You can add a VPC or VLAN interface directly to a Linode instance resource.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const web = new linode.Instance("web", {
 *     label: "simple_instance",
 *     image: "linode/ubuntu22.04",
 *     region: "us-central",
 *     type: "g6-standard-1",
 *     authorizedKeys: ["ssh-rsa AAAA...Gw== user@example.local"],
 *     rootPass: "this-is-not-a-safe-password",
 *     interfaces: [
 *         {
 *             purpose: "public",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             purpose: "vpc",
 *             subnetId: 123,
 *             ipv4: {
 *                 vpc: "10.0.4.250",
 *             },
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     tags: ["foo"],
 *     swapSize: 256,
 *     privateIp: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Linode Instance Assigned to a Placement Group
 *
 * The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a Linode instance assigned to a
 * Placement Group.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const my_instance = new linode.Instance("my-instance", {
 *     label: "my-instance",
 *     region: "us-mia",
 *     type: "g6-standard-1",
 *     placementGroup: {
 *         id: 12345,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Linodes Instances can be imported using the Linode `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import linode:index/instance:Instance mylinode 1234567
 * ```
 *
 * When importing an instance, all `disk` and `config` values must be represented.
 *
 * Imported disks must include their `label` value.  **Any disk that is not precisely represented may be removed resulting in data loss.**
 *
 * Imported configs should include all `devices`, and must include `label`, `kernel`, and the `root_device`.  The instance must include a `boot_config_label` referring to the correct configuration profile.
