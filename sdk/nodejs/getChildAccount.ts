/**
 * Provides information about a Linode Child Account.
 * For more information, see the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-child-account).
 *
 * Due to the sensitive nature of the data exposed by this data source, it should not be used in conjunction with the `LINODE_DEBUG` option.  See the [debugging notes](https://www.terraform.io/providers/linode/linode/latest/docs#debugging) for more details.
 *
 * **NOTE: Parent/Child related features may not be generally available.**
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example shows how one might use this data source to access child account details.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const account = linode.getChildAccount({
 *     euuid: "FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF",
 * });
