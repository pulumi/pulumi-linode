/**
 * Provides information about a Linode user
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example shows how one might use this data source to access information about a Linode user.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const foo = pulumi.output(linode.getUser({
 *     username: "foo",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
 * ## Attributes
 *
 * The Linode User resource exports the following attributes:
 *
 * * `sshKeys` - A list of SSH Key labels added by this User. These are the keys that will be deployed if this User is included in the authorizedUsers field of a create Linode, rebuild Linode, or create Disk request.
 *
 * * `email` - The email address for this User, for account management communications, and may be used for other communications as configured.
 *
 * * `restricted` - If true, this User must be granted access to perform actions or access entities on this Account.
