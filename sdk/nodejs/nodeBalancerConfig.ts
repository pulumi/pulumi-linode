/**
 * Provides a Linode NodeBalancer Config resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linodes NodeBalancer Configs.
 * For more information, see [Getting Started with NodeBalancers](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/nodebalancer/getting-started-with-nodebalancers/) and the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4#operation/createNodeBalancerConfig).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a NodeBalancer Config attached to a Linode instance.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const foobar = new linode.NodeBalancer("foobar", {
 *     clientConnThrottle: 20,
 *     label: "mynodebalancer",
 *     region: "us-east",
 * });
 * const foofig = new linode.NodeBalancerConfig("foofig", {
 *     algorithm: "source",
 *     check: "http",
 *     checkAttempts: 3,
 *     checkPath: "/foo",
 *     checkTimeout: 30,
 *     nodebalancerId: foobar.id.apply(id => Number.parseFloat(id)),
 *     port: 8088,
 *     protocol: "http",
 *     stickiness: "http_cookie",
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Attributes
 *
 * This resource exports the following attributes:
 *
 * * `sslCommonname` - The common name for the SSL certification this port is serving if this port is not configured to use SSL.
 *
 * * `sslFingerprint` - The fingerprint for the SSL certification this port is serving if this port is not configured to use SSL.
 *
 * * `nodeStatusUp` - The number of backends considered to be 'UP' and healthy, and that are serving requests.
 *
 * * `nodeStatusDown` - The number of backends considered to be 'DOWN' and unhealthy. These are not in rotation, and not serving requests.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * NodeBalancer Configs can be imported using the NodeBalancer `nodebalancer_id` followed by the NodeBalancer Config `id` separated by a comma, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import linode:index/nodeBalancerConfig:NodeBalancerConfig http-foobar 1234567,7654321
 * ```
 *
 *  The Linode Guide, [Import Existing Infrastructure to Terraform](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/configuration-management/import-existing-infrastructure-to-terraform/), offers resource importing examples for NodeBalancer Configs and other Linode resource types.
