/**
 * Provides a Linode NodeBalancer Config resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linodes NodeBalancer Configs.
 * For more information, see [Getting Started with NodeBalancers](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/nodebalancer/getting-started-with-nodebalancers/) and the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-node-balancer-config).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a NodeBalancer Config attached to a Linode instance.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as linode from "@pulumi/linode";
 *
 * const foobar = new linode.NodeBalancer("foobar", {
 *     label: "mynodebalancer",
 *     region: "us-east",
 *     clientConnThrottle: 20,
 * });
 * const foofig = new linode.NodeBalancerConfig("foofig", {
 *     nodebalancerId: foobar.id,
 *     port: 8088,
 *     protocol: "http",
 *     check: "http",
 *     checkPath: "/foo",
 *     checkAttempts: 3,
 *     checkTimeout: 30,
 *     udpCheckPort: 12345,
 *     stickiness: "http_cookie",
 *     algorithm: "source",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * NodeBalancer Configs can be imported using the NodeBalancer `nodebalancer_id` followed by the NodeBalancer Config `id` separated by a comma, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import linode:index/nodeBalancerConfig:NodeBalancerConfig http-foobar 1234567,7654321
 * ```
