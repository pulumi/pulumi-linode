// Provides a Linode NodeBalancer Config resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linodes NodeBalancer Configs.
// For more information, see [Getting Started with NodeBalancers](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/nodebalancer/getting-started-with-nodebalancers/) and the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4#operation/createNodeBalancerConfig).
//
// ## Example Usage
//
// The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a NodeBalancer Config attached to a Linode instance.
//
// ```go
// package main
//
// import (
// 	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi-linode/sdk/v2/go/linode"
// 	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v2/go/pulumi"
// )
//
// func main() {
// 	pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
// 		foobar, err := linode.NewNodeBalancer(ctx, "foobar", &linode.NodeBalancerArgs{
// 			ClientConnThrottle: pulumi.Int(20),
// 			Label:              pulumi.String("mynodebalancer"),
// 			Region:             pulumi.String("us-east"),
// 		})
// 		if err != nil {
// 			return err
// 		}
// 		_, err = linode.NewNodeBalancerConfig(ctx, "foofig", &linode.NodeBalancerConfigArgs{
// 			Algorithm:      pulumi.String("source"),
// 			Check:          pulumi.String("http"),
// 			CheckAttempts:  pulumi.Int(3),
// 			CheckPath:      pulumi.String("/foo"),
// 			CheckTimeout:   pulumi.Int(30),
// 			NodebalancerId: foobar.ID(),
// 			Port:           pulumi.Int(8088),
// 			Protocol:       pulumi.String("http"),
// 			Stickiness:     pulumi.String("http_cookie"),
// 		})
// 		if err != nil {
// 			return err
// 		}
// 		return nil
// 	})
// }
// ```
// ## Attributes
//
// This resource exports the following attributes:
//
// * `sslCommonname` - The common name for the SSL certification this port is serving if this port is not configured to use SSL.
//
// * `sslFingerprint` - The fingerprint for the SSL certification this port is serving if this port is not configured to use SSL.
//
// * `nodeStatus` - The status of the attached nodes.
//
// ### nodeStatus
//
// The following attributes are available on node_status:
//
// * `up` - The number of backends considered to be 'UP' and healthy, and that are serving requests.
//
// * `down` - The number of backends considered to be 'DOWN' and unhealthy. These are not in rotation, and not serving requests.
//
// ## Import
//
// NodeBalancer Configs can be imported using the NodeBalancer `nodebalancer_id` followed by the NodeBalancer Config `id` separated by a comma, e.g.
//
// ```sh
//  $ pulumi import linode:index/nodeBalancerConfig:NodeBalancerConfig http-foobar 1234567,7654321
// ```
//
//  The Linode Guide, [Import Existing Infrastructure to Terraform](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/configuration-management/import-existing-infrastructure-to-terraform/), offers resource importing examples for NodeBalancer Configs and other Linode resource types.
