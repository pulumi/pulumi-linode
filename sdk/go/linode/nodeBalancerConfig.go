// Provides a Linode NodeBalancer Config resource.  This can be used to create, modify, and delete Linodes NodeBalancer Configs.
// For more information, see [Getting Started with NodeBalancers](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/nodebalancer/getting-started-with-nodebalancers/) and the [Linode APIv4 docs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-node-balancer-config).
//
// ## Example Usage
//
// The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a NodeBalancer Config attached to a Linode instance.
//
// ```go
// package main
//
// import (
//
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi-linode/sdk/v5/go/linode"
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi"
//
// )
//
//	func main() {
//		pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
//			foobar, err := linode.NewNodeBalancer(ctx, "foobar", &linode.NodeBalancerArgs{
//				Label:              pulumi.String("mynodebalancer"),
//				Region:             pulumi.String("us-east"),
//				ClientConnThrottle: pulumi.Int(20),
//			})
//			if err != nil {
//				return err
//			}
//			_, err = linode.NewNodeBalancerConfig(ctx, "foofig", &linode.NodeBalancerConfigArgs{
//				NodebalancerId: foobar.ID(),
//				Port:           pulumi.Int(8088),
//				Protocol:       pulumi.String("http"),
//				Check:          pulumi.String("http"),
//				CheckPath:      pulumi.String("/foo"),
//				CheckAttempts:  pulumi.Int(3),
//				CheckTimeout:   pulumi.Int(30),
//				UdpCheckPort:   pulumi.Int(12345),
//				Stickiness:     pulumi.String("http_cookie"),
//				Algorithm:      pulumi.String("source"),
//			})
//			if err != nil {
//				return err
//			}
//			return nil
//		})
//	}
//
// ```
//
// ## Import
//
// NodeBalancer Configs can be imported using the NodeBalancer `nodebalancer_id` followed by the NodeBalancer Config `id` separated by a comma, e.g.
//
// ```sh
// $ pulumi import linode:index/nodeBalancerConfig:NodeBalancerConfig http-foobar 1234567,7654321
// ```
