    /// ## Example Usage
    /// ### Simple Linode Instance
    /// 
    /// The following example shows how one might use this resource to configure a Linode instance.
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Linode = Pulumi.Linode;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;

    ///
