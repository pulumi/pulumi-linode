        /// 
        /// The Linode Profile resource exports the following attributes:
        /// 
        /// * `email` - The profile email address. This address will be used for communication with Linode as necessary.
        /// 
        /// * `timezone` - The profile's preferred timezone. This is not used by the API, and is for the benefit of clients only. All times the API returns are in UTC.
        /// 
        /// * `email_notifications` - If true, email notifications will be sent about account activity. If false, when false business-critical communications may still be sent through email.
        /// 
        /// * `username` - The username for logging in to Linode services.
        /// 
        /// * `ip_whitelist_enabled` - If true, logins for the user will only be allowed from whitelisted IPs. This setting is currently deprecated, and cannot be enabled.
        /// 
        /// * `lish_auth_method` - The methods of authentication allowed when connecting via Lish. 'keys_only' is the most secure with the intent to use Lish, and 'disabled' is recommended for users that will not use Lish at all.
        /// 
        /// * `authorized_keys` - The list of SSH Keys authorized to use Lish for this user. This value is ignored if lish_auth_method is 'disabled'.
        /// 
        /// * `two_factor_auth` - If true, logins from untrusted computers will require Two Factor Authentication.
        /// 
        /// * `restricted` - If true, the user has restrictions on what can be accessed on the Account.
        /// 
        /// * `referrals` - Credit Card information associated with this Account.
        /// 
        /// * `referrals.0.total` - The number of users who have signed up with the referral code.
        /// 
        /// * `referrals.0.credit` - The amount of account credit in US Dollars issued to the account through the referral program.
        /// 
        /// * `referrals.0.completed` - The number of completed signups with the referral code.
        /// 
        /// * `referrals.0.pending` - The number of pending signups for the referral code. To receive credit the signups must be completed.
        /// 
        /// * `referrals.0.code` - The Profile referral code.  If new accounts use this when signing up for Linode, referring account will receive credit.
        /// 
        /// * `referrals.0.url` - The referral URL.
