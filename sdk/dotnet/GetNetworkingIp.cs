        /// 
        /// * `address` - The IP address.
        /// 
        /// * `gateway` - The default gateway for this address.
        /// 
        /// * `subnet_mask` - The mask that separates host bits from network bits for this address.
        /// 
        /// * `prefix` - The number of bits set in the subnet mask.
        /// 
        /// * `type` - The type of address this is (ipv4, ipv6, ipv6/pool, ipv6/range).
        /// 
        /// * `public` - Whether this is a public or private IP address.
        /// 
        /// * `rdns` - The reverse DNS assigned to this address. For public IPv4 addresses, this will be set to a default value provided by Linode if not explicitly set.
        /// 
        /// * `linode_id` - The ID of the Linode this address currently belongs to.
        /// 
        /// * `region` - The Region this IP address resides in.
